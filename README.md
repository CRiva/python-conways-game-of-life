# python-conways-game-of-life

This is a slightly altered version of [Conways Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life)

You will need to make sure you download a copy of the [Graphics.py](http://mcsp.wartburg.edu/zelle/python/graphics.py) code in order for this to work. You can create a folder `graphics` and put the graphics code in an `__init__.py` file because the GOL code calls `from graphics import *`

To run the code, run `python3 conways_gol.py` from the command line.
